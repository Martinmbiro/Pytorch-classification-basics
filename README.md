Hello again 👋
+ This repository demonstrates the steps followed in creating, training, and evaluating a simple multi-class classification neural network using the [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) library.
+ The model is trained on the popular toy dataset - the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html)
+ Comments, working code, and links to the latest official documentation are included every step of the way
+ There are links to open each notebook in Google Colab - feel free to play around with the code


## Milestones 🏁
**Concepts covered in this exercise include:**  
1. [x] Data wrangling and visualization
2. [x] Training and evaluating a multi-class classification model- build using [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/)
3. [x] Early-stopping

## Tools ⚒️
1. [`Google Colab`](https://colab.google/) - A hosted _Jupyter Notebook_ service by Google.
2. [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) -  An open-source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language, that is used for building **Deep Learning models**
3. [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#) - A free open-source library that offers Machine Learning tools for the Python programming language
4. [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
5. [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for making static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
6. [`torchinfo`](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) - A library for viewing model summaries in PyTorch

## Results 📈
> On a scale of `0` -> `1`, the model achieved:
+ A weighted `precision`, `recall`, and `f1_score` of `0.97`
+ An overall model accuracy of `0.9667`
+ An overall `roc_auc_score` of `0.9933`

> The saved model's `state_dict` can be found in the `model` folder of the current repository.
